# ATM-SYSTEM
For this project, the primary task at hand is to create a system that acts like an ATM machine of a particular bank. The system's purpose is to perform various tasks that a normal ATM would, in addition to being a sub-component of a banking organization. This system will consist of three modules; the account module, account authentication module and account transaction module. The account module will have components such as creating the bank account, adding a bank branch, viewing the bank account, freezing or opening the account, and changing the personal identification number (PIN). This module will be run by an administrator, such as the bank teller or branch manager. The second module, the account authentication module, will check if the person using the machine is a pre-existing customer with the bank, and perform a verification step to determine whether or not their account exists. Any accounts that are frozen or do not exist will not be allowed to use the ATM system. The account transaction module will be used by the customer. This module will allow the customer to withdraw cash, deposit cash, deposit cheques, transfer money, view account balance and view their transaction history. These 3 modules will be broken down into smaller sub-components and be used together to create the entire system.
